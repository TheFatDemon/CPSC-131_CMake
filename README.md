# CSUF CPSC-131 Assignments

## Hi There

Seems that you stumbled across my project while looking around for some solutions.

Not to worry, I think I got you covered.

You need to use CMake to compile this project but it's possible to just look at the source files directly

If there's any changes you recommend, please do create a pull request
